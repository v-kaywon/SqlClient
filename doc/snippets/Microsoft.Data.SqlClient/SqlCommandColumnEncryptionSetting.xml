## Remarks
-   If Always Encrypted is disabled for a query and the query has parameters that need to be encrypted (parameters that correspond to encrypted columns), the query will fail.  
-   If Always Encrypted is disabled for a query and the query returns results from encrypted columns, the query will return encrypted values. The encrypted values will have the varbinary datatype.
