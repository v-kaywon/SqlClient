# Microsoft SqlClient Data Provider for SQL Server

## What is Microsoft.Data.SqlClient?

Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is a data provider for Microsoft Sql Server. Currently in preview, it is a union of the two System.Data.SqlClient components which live independently in .NET Framework and .NET Core. Going forward, support for new SQL Server features will be implemented in Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.

The Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package supports .NET Framework 4.6+, .NET Core 2.1+, and .NET Standard 2.0+.

The current preview of this library has been released under a proprietary, closed source license. When the code is migrated to this repository, future releases from that code will be released under the MIT license.
