### Known Issues

* When targeting .NET Framework and platform AnyCPU or x86, you may see a build warning about processor architecture mismatch:

  *Warning There was a mismatch between the processor architecture of the project being built "MSIL" and the processor architecture of the reference "Microsoft.Data.SqlClient...*

  This is because Microsoft.Data.SqlClient targeting .NET Framework contains a native code component and native components cannot target AnyCPU. Currently x64 is the only platform supported when targeting .NET Framework. To resolve the warning, change your application to target x64. This will be resolved in a future release.
