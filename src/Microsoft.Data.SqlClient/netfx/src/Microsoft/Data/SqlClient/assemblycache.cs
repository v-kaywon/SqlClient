//ThisAssembly class keeps a map of the following:
//AssemblyName to AssemblyID
//TypeName to TypeID
//AssemblyID to AssemblyRef and State
//TypeID to TypeRef and AssemblyId
//
//Adding an assembly to this class will NOT enable users to create types from that assembly. Users should explicitely add type details and link types to assemblies.
// This class also registers for assembly resolve events so that dependent assemblies can be resolved if they are registered.
//This class does NOT know anything about assembly dependencies. It simply loads assemblies as handed over to it.
//Users can take advantage of connection pooling by tying this instance to a pooling-aware component.
